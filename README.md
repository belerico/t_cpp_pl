# The C ++ programming language solved exercises

[The C ++ programming language] (https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) by B. Stroustrup is a milestone for those who want to grasp C++ on a deeper level.
Here I share my solutions to the book exercises, which you can find [here] (https://www.stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf). This is the first time I program in C++, so my solutions can be further improved: if anyone has questions or finds bugs, please fill in an issue, so that we can discuss it openly.

# The C ++ programming language solved exercises

[The C ++ programming language](https://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) by B. Stroustrup is a milestone for those who want to grasp C++ on a deeper level.
Here I share my solutions to the 4th edition book exercises, which you can find [here](https://www.stroustrup.com/4thExercises.pdf).  
This is the first time I program in C++, so my solutions can be further improved: if anyone has questions or finds bugs, please fill in an issue, so that we can discuss it openly.

## Folder structure

* **X.Y.Z** folders follow the exercises enumeration, so X.Y is the paragraph and Z is the exercise number
* **Code from the book** contains useful code snippets from the main book, i.e. the class Vector, Complex and so on
